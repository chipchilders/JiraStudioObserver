This is a supybot plugin that supports watching specific Activity Streams 
from Jira Studio, and provides updates into a specified channel.

Special thanks to the feedparser.org team (http://feedparser.org/).  I
have included their feedparser module within this codebase for now, but
eventually will extract it in favor of having "easy_install feedparser"
be a prerequisite.
